I’m was an IT Manager for the better part of 20 years and have now returned to software development. I am also a lover of RaspberryPis, Arduino's and small electronic projects. Outside of computers it’s roller skating and disk golf, although right now I have a 9 month old border collie that takes up most of my free time.
